*Click OK

The 'Beer Fridge' will now fill up, each supplier supplies 5 cartons, within each carton contains 25 beers

--Drinking 'Beer'--
*Click Add Drinker
*Enter a name when prompted 
*Click OK

The Beers will now begin to run out, a counter in the top title bar will tell you how many beers have been drunk, and how many have been supplied. Each drinker can drink a maximum of 15 drinks.

Each drinker and supplier has its own thread, there is a random delay between each drink the drinker has.
